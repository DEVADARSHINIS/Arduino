These are few basic Arduino codes that helped me a lot in exploring more on Arduino and Internet of Things (IoT).

COMPONENTS USED IN SIMULATION:
-> Arduino Uno
-> Bread Board Small
-> Bread Board Big
-> Resistors
-> Jumper Wires
-> Red LED 
-> Blue LED 
-> Green LED 
-> Passive Buzzer
-> RGB LED's
-> Photoresistor
-> Thermistor
-> DHT Sensor
-> Push Button
-> Switches
-> Potentiometer
-> 7 Segment Display
-> 4-Digit Seven Segment Display
-> 8*8 Matrix

Libraries Used:
-> pitch.h (Used for Melody Buzzer) 
-> DHT.h   (Used for Temperature sensor)
-> DHT_U.h (Used for Temperature sensor)
-> SevSeg.h (Used for seven segment display)
